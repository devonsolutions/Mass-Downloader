# Mass Downloader

This is a mass downloader for Drupal 7 and Drupal 10 files. If a file is available (returns a 200 status code), then it will be downloaded into the "downloads" folder. If a file is unavailable (returns a 404 status code), then an error message will be printed to the terminal.

The Requests (Python) library sends out an HTTP GET request for data. When a webpage is available, users receive a 200 status code.

Note: Can use Financial & Support Services as an example
